    <p class="first-paragraph">The Ghanaian culture cannot be considered a uniform one. Rather, it consists of hundreds of different ethnic influences and tribes who speak their own dialects and their own languages, having different cultural backgrounds. However, the different
        Ghanaian ethnic groups largely share one common belief: the naming of their children.</p>
    <hr class="my-2">

    <p class="second-paragraph"> Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.For females, matching is as follows; <strong>Akosua,Monday: Adwoa,Tuesday: Abenaa, Wednesday: Akua Thursday: Yaa,Friday: Afua,Saturday: Ama, while for males, matching is as follows:Sunday: Kwasi,Monday: Kwadwo,Tuesday: Kwabena,Wednesday: Kwaku,Thursday:  Yaw,Friday: Kofi,Saturday: Kwame.</strong:></p>
